# SAMS
SAMS: Surface Analysis, Mapping, and Statistics

This is a package containing software that allows for simultaneous matching of surfaces as well as a degree of statistical analysis. This package is suitable for rigid, homeomorphic, simply connected surfaces like anatomical surfaces and not for other datasets of interests such as SCAPE, FAUST, or non-homeomorphic or non-simply connected data.

***Instructions***

1. Download SAMS into your desired directory
2. Edit the following files as needed: ./Setup/AlignmentSetup.m, ./Setup/MappingSetup.m, ./Setup/StatisticsSetup.m
3. OPTIONAL: If data is not already aligned, run Execute00
4. Run the files starting in  Execute01, Execute02, and Execute03.

The alignment package Auto3dgm (http://github.com/trgao10/PuenteAlignment) is included in the Alignment folder for convenience, though was modified so as to work with file structure and does not have the capabilities for distributed computing at the original package. **If you utilize Auto3dgm, please cite:**
