# Aligning_Stuff
 Cleaned version of Duke Tooth & Claw's SAMS/Hecate package. This doesn't produce so many pop-ups. Works in Matlab R2021a, if I'm not mistaken. The Matlab code used to give a meaningless error saying the meshes needed to be cleaned; in reality, Matlab changed a function's name and the code was crashing. I think I fixed that in this version, but Matlab may have changed it again since that. 

To align stuff: utilize Auto3dgm_Python.py (in the Auto3dgm folder). 

To segment stuff: after alignment, run Execute 01 - 03a in SAMS folder. 

 Disclaimer: I am not the author of any of this code. I changed a few things in the SAMS package for fewer obnoxious pop-up's and to fix function usage. I am only hosting this code here since my Google Drive storage is currently full.
